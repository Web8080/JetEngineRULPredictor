# JetEngineRULPredictor
This repository contains the complete code and documentation for predicting the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of engines using the NASA CMAPSS Turbofan Jet Engine dataset. The project leverages advanced machine learning techniques, including XGBoost and LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory), to model engine degradation based on time-series sensor data.
